# La-Jolla
Located overlooking beautiful [Best Restaurants in La Jolla](https://lajollainsiders.com/), Brockton Villa has one of the best locations in La Jolla.  Meals are reasonably priced - $15 for breakfast and lunch, maybe $25 for dinner.  In La Jolla these are great prices, especially for a view this good.  Get there before sunset and you will be loving life.

This historic building was once one of the original La Jolla beach cottages, built in the late 1800’s on a site purchased for $165 - that’s about what a dinner for two will cost you up the street.  Come dine here and imagine a life on the coast and be swept away but the sound of the waves as you dine on great food at a great price.
